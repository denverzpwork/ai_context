We work with context inside the ai_context/tasks/TASK-ID directory.
Using:
- spec.md as the source of requirements
- plan.md as the implementation intent
- context.md as constraints
analyze the existing code.

Need to prepare implementation.md as an implementation description.

The file may contain:
- structural decisions
- deviations from the plan
- important trade-offs
- follow-up tasks / technical debt

We only specify existing information. We don't make up non-existent things.
