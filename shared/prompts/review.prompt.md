We work with context inside the ai_context/tasks/TASK-ID directory.
Using:
- spec.md as the source of requirements
- plan.md as the implementation intent
- context.md as constraints
analyze the existing code.

Need to prepare review.md as a functionality description.

The file must contain a human-readable description of:
- what was done
- necessary additional settings
- necessary actions (migrations, etc.)
- follow-up tasks / technical debt

We only specify existing information. We don't make up non-existent things.
